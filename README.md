# DrugToleranceHallmarks
A repository of code for the study of Transcriptional Hallmarks of Drug Tolerance in Hormone-Dependent Cancers.

The datasets contain transcriptional profiles of 300'000 cells from breast and prostate tumor cell lines (MCF7 and LNCaP) treated with/resistant against treatment with endocrine therapies (ET) and CDK inhibitors.

The raw data will be available on GEO shortly.

Intermediate objects for the analyses can be found in two zenodo repositories: LINKS

## Reproducing the analyses
For reproducing the analyses, download the code from this github repository and the two zenodo repositories above into the same directory. The folder structure is similar between them and combining them will allow to load all the intermediate files and annotations necessary to run the scripts.
